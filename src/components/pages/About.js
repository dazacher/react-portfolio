            My name is Dee Ann Scanniello. I am a Full Stack Web Developer, self-driven and easily adaptable with a passion for learning, problem-solving and collaborating in a team environment. Quick learner, who enjoys challenges and collaboration. Leveraging my 10+ years programming experience in Ada, C# and SQL for the Insurance industry, Aeronautics Industry and Semiconductor industry to analyze complex problems and build creative solutions. A graduate from the University of Arizona Bootcamp with a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development and a Bachelorâ€™s degree from DeVry University in Computer Information Systems. What I love about programming is that you never stop learning. More importantly, I love to create anything imagined, test it and improve it as technology progresses. Proven soft-skills such as independent, organized, motivated, conflict resolution, working remotely on teams, and detail-oriented.  Looking to grow as a programmer and eventually become a mentor to others. Actively seeking an organization that provides a challenging, inclusive, diverse work environment.
